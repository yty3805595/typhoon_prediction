# typhoon_prediction
 # typhoon Analysis satellite images of typhoons by deep-learning (CNN), based on PyTorch.    This CNN learns to map the satellite images of typhoons to their max wind speed from. The labeled train set is obtained from agora/JMA.     ## Requirements * BeautifulSoup   * PIL   * Pytorch    ## Usage 1. Run `download.py`, download the satellite images of typhoons to folder `tys_raw`.   2. Run `create_samples.py`, convert raw data into the legal samples for our CNN, create two new forlder `train_set` and `test_set`.   3. Train CNN using `train_net.py`, the trained CNN will be saved as a disk file `net_relu.pt`.   4. Run `test_net.py`, analysis the test set.    After 10 epoches training the CNN regressor reached mean loss about 8 (knots) in train set and about 10 (knots) in test set.   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melissa135/deep_typhoon/master/loss_sequence.png)    Here is what this CNN thinks of the top 20 typhoons sorted by max wind.   ``` 1 ('197920', 130.27679443359375)   2 ('200914', 127.7662582397461)   3 ('199019', 122.92172241210938)   4 ('200918', 122.84004211425781)   5 ('201614', 122.66597747802734)   6 ('201601', 122.03250885009766)   7 ('201513', 121.75947570800781)   8 ('200922', 121.35771942138672)   9 ('201013', 120.0194091796875)   10 ('201330', 118.92587280273438)   11 ('201419', 117.6025390625)   12 ('198305', 117.10270690917969)   13 ('201422', 116.77259063720703)   14 ('198522', 116.46116638183594)   15 ('201327', 116.42304992675781)   16 ('201216', 116.36921691894531)   17 ('198221', 116.18096923828125)   18 ('199230', 115.96656799316406)   19 ('198210', 115.96611022949219)   20 ('201328', 115.57132720947266)   ```  ## Tips * Memory should be at least 1.5G .   * This project is written without `cuda()`, while you can use `cuda()` to transfer the CNN onto GPU and speedup the training.   * The images and labels are crawled from agora.ax.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon , and the labels are refered to JMA(Japan Meteorological agency).
